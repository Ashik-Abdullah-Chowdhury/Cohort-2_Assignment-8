# Cohort-2_Assignment-8

## Description
This repository contains a comparative analysis of supervised and unsupervised classification methods. It includes a JavaScript code file for data processing or interaction, visual representations (PNGs) showcasing the results of both supervised and unsupervised classification, and a comprehensive PDF report detailing the methodology, findings, and comparison between the two classification approaches.
